## React Template

A simple React project for VoltBuilder apps.

This project is made using the [standard React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). 
After the tutorial is complete, you should have a dist folder in your project. 
Copy the contents of that to the www folder in this project.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo onto your system.
1. Zip the contents of the Template folder.
1. [Upload to VoltBuilder](https://volt.build/upload/) using the Android option.
1. Wait about a minute for it to finish.
1. Install the apk that is returned onto your device.

## iOS

iOS Signing requires developer specific files. This project just has placeholders for them.
You can generate signing files using [VoltSigner](https://volt.build/certificate/) if you have an Apple Developer account,
then add them to this project.
